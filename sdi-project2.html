<article>
<p>My theme this week for Project 2 was basically an continuation of my last week's theme about my work day.</p>
<p>Instead of talking about what I did at work, I talked about what I do after work and I came up with a story about me and my friends going to the movies.</p>
<p>For the most part, this assignment was a breezy, but I did have a few difficults. This class keeps getting better and better and hopefully, you all enjoy my story.</p>
